## How to Decode Cryptographic Messages/Flags

### The Flag

The flag to decode is:

```
Jxu vbqw yi jxu dkcruh ev sxqhqsjuhi jxyi ijhydw mqi ixyvjut tkhydw jxu udshofjyed fhesuii. Hucucruh, jxu squiqh ixyvj yi jxhuu. Mxqj mqi jxyi ixyvj?
```

I think it's a question.

### Identifying the Cipher

To identify the cipher, use the website: [dCode Cipher Identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier)

Most likely, it's a Caesar cipher. Click on it.

Yes, the first option looks good.

### Decoding the Message

The problem: The flag is the number of characters this string was shifted during the encryption process. Remember, the Caesar shift is three. What was this shift?

The number of characters this string was shifted during the encryption process is **sixteen**.

As dCode shows it next to the given cleartext: ðŸ ž 16 (ðŸ œ 10)

Pretty cool stuff! This is how ciphertext can be decoded.
