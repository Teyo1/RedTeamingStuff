This section consists how to decode cryptographic messages/flags.

the flag is following: Jxu vbqw yi jxu dkcruh ev sxqhqsjuhi jxyi ijhydw mqi ixyvjut tkhydw jxu udshofjyed fhesuii. Hucucruh, jxu squiqh ixyvj yi jxhuu. Mxqj mqi jxyi ixyvj? I think it's a question.

Let's open a website: https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier
Here we can identify the cipher.

Most likely Caesar cipher, click it.

Yeah, the first one looks good.

Next problem: The flag is the number of characters this string was shifted during the encryption process. Remember, the caesar shift is three. What was this shift?

The number of characters this string was shifted during the encryption process is sixteen. 
As dCode shows it next to the given cleartext ðŸ ž16 (ðŸ œ10)

Pretty cool stuff, this is how ciphertext can be decoded.
