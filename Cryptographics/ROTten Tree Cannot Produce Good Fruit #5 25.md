## Decoding the Message

Now that we know how to solve it, let’s check if the last one is any trickier.

### Question

What is the last name of the person that said this?

> “Rfc zpgai uyjjq ypc rfcpc dmp y pcyqml. Rfc zpgai uyjjq ypc lmr rfcpc rm iccn sq msr. Rfc zpgai uyjjq ypc rfcpc rm egtc sq y afylac rm qfmu fmu zybjw uc uylr qmkcrfgle. Zcaysqc rfc zpgai uyjjq ypc rfcpc rm qrmn rfc ncmnjc ufm bml’r uylr gr zybjw clmsef. Rfcw’pc rfcpc rm qrmn rfc mrfcp ncmnjc.”

... please watch his famous speech.

### Solution Steps

1. **Visit the Cipher Identifier**:

   Go to [dCode Cipher Identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) and input the cipher text.

2. **Decipher the Text**:

   The cleartext decoded from the cipher is:

   > “The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the other people.”

   This quote is attributed to Randy Pausch.

4. **Answer to the Question**:

   The last name of the person who said this quote is **Pausch**.

### Conclusion

This concludes the Standard ROT ciphers. Standard ROT ciphers have limited permutations (25 in total). The next form of encryption involves interweaving multiple ROTs based on a key.
