QR Code Credential Harvest

## Poster with QR Code

- **Effectiveness**: Using a poster with a QR code can be highly effective for credential harvesting. By presenting an enticing offer, like a job opportunity, and using a QR code to direct individuals to a malicious site, you can trick people into entering their credentials.
- **Target Audience**: This approach is effective for professionals actively seeking new job opportunities. The lure of a potential job, especially one that promises great pay, can be persuasive.

## Scenario for Usage

- **Scenario**: The poster advertises a job opportunity with great pay, encouraging people to scan the QR code to apply. The QR code directs them to a fake LinkedIn login page designed to capture their credentials.
- **Specific Group**: This is targeted at professionals who are looking for job opportunities and may be eager to apply for a seemingly lucrative position. They are more likely to be persuaded by the promise of good pay.

## Harvesting Tool

- **Website**: The website used for harvesting credentials is set up to mimic a LinkedIn login page. The `zphisher` tool was used to create this phishing page.
- **Testing**: The QR code and associated website were tested to confirm that the tool is functioning correctly.

## Outcome

- **Phishing Success**: If the target enters their LinkedIn credentials on the fake page, the attacker gains access to their LinkedIn account. This could lead to unauthorized activities and potential risks, such as identity theft or other forms of exploitation.

## QR Code Creation

- **Link Shortener**: A link shortener (`t.ly`) was used to make the URL more manageable and less suspicious.
- **Poster Design**: Canva was used to design the poster, which featured a call-to-action to scan the QR code for a job opportunity.

## Results

- **Data Collection**: The credentials were successfully harvested, as shown by the screenshots.

## Recommendations and Considerations

1. **Ethical Use**: Ensure that such techniques are used ethically and legally. Always have explicit permission if conducting security awareness tests or penetration tests.
2. **Awareness Training**: This experience can be used to educate others about phishing risks and how to recognize and avoid them.
