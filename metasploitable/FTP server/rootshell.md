# Chapter: Initial Access

In this chapter, we'll explore different methods to gain access to the system. First, we need to identify potential attack vectors.

As discussed in the previous enumeration chapter, multiple ports are open on the target system. Now, our aim is to establish initial access through these ports.

## Nmap Scan Results

Below are the results of the Nmap scan conducted:

```plaintext
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.15
Host is up, received syn-ack (0.00020s latency).
Scanned at 2024-05-17 21:05:30 EEST for 11s

```

Some of the services hint the version, which helps us identify potential vulnerabilities.

## What is Port 21/FTP

We'll focus on exploiting the FTP service running on port 21.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) serves as a fundamental tool for file sharing and management within networks. However, the importance of regularly updating FTP services cannot be overstated due to several critical reasons:

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Like any software, FTP servers are susceptible to security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, compromise server integrity, or launch attacks on other network resources. Updating the FTP service ensures that known security vulnerabilities are patched, minimizing the risk of exploitation.

2. **Protection Against Exploits**: Hackers continually search for vulnerabilities in software, including FTP servers, to exploit them for malicious purposes. Outdated FTP servers become easy targets for exploitation as security patches provided by software vendors are not applied. Regular updates help mitigate the risk of being targeted by exploits, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored and transmitted via FTP.

3. **Compliance Requirements**: Many regulatory frameworks and industry standards mandate the regular updating of software to ensure data security and compliance. For instance, regulations such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) require organizations to implement security measures, including the timely patching of software vulnerabilities. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines, legal penalties, and reputational damage.

4. **Enhanced Security Features**: Software updates often include enhancements to security features and functionalities. Updated FTP servers may offer improved encryption algorithms, stronger authentication mechanisms, and enhanced access controls, bolstering the overall security posture of the network infrastructure. By staying current with updates, organizations can leverage these security enhancements to better protect sensitive data and mitigate emerging threats.

5. **Maintaining System Stability**: In addition to security considerations, updating FTP services can contribute to the overall stability and performance of the system. Updates may address performance issues, compatibility concerns with other software components, and ensure interoperability with evolving technology standards. By keeping FTP servers up to date, organizations can maintain system stability, minimize downtime, and optimize operational efficiency.

In summary, regular updates to FTP services are essential for maintaining a secure and resilient network infrastructure. By proactively addressing security vulnerabilities, adhering to compliance requirements, and leveraging enhanced security features, organizations can mitigate risks, protect sensitive data, and uphold the integrity of their IT environments.

## Exploiting Port 21/FTP

1. Open Metasploit in the terminal using the command `sudo msfconsole`.
2. Search for the exploit targeting vsftpd.

## Post-Exploitation

After successfully exploiting the vulnerability, we have gained root access to the target machine.

Now, we have complete control over the Linux machine, allowing us to perform various actions, such as creating files.

## Viewing Created File

To demonstrate our control, let's create a file on the compromised machine.
