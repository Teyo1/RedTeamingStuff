### Overview of Telnet's Original Purpose:

Telnet, developed in the 1960s, enabled remote terminal access and control, allowing users to interact with remote computers. Key features include terminal emulation and text-based communication.


### Why Telnet Shouldn't Be Used Anymore:

Telnet, once popular for remote terminal access, is now deprecated due to:

1. **Unencrypted Communication**: Telnet transmits data in plain text, exposing sensitive information to interception.

2. **Lack of Authentication**: Telnet lacks robust authentication and authorization, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3. **Security Risks**: Telnet implementations have vulnerabilities, risking system compromise.

4. **Protocol Limitations**: It lacks modern security features like encryption and multi-factor authentication.
