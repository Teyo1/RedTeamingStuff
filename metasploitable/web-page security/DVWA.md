This chapter will tell about webpage vulnerabilities. We will be focusing on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)).

Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.
